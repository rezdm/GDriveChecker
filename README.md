# GDriveChecker

## What and why
In 2014 I've got a big update in my family situation and I needed something to privately share family photos with those who're interested in. In my daily life I use Googld Drive and using these photos using google drive seemed to be proper solution. However, I was tired of manually notifying all, who are interested of new photos. I needed a quick solution for that, but I sort of don't like scripting-style solutions, thus I decided to implement something on my own. However, since that time I lost the source code, so I decided to re-do this util.
